# Advent of Code 2019

Somebody suggested it might be fun to try and solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using Rockstar... here. Hold my beer.

* [Day 1](day01/) - **solved**. Although I had to add arithmetic rounding to the language spec.
* [Day 2](day02/) – **solved**. Ths one took a while because, um, Rockstar didn't have arrays. Or any kind of split 
operation. Or any kind of type conversion. But now it does. Read all about [Adding Arrays to Rockstar](day02/adding_arrays_to_rockstar)
* Day 3 - no solution yet.
* [Day 4](day04/) - **solved** 
  * also solved by [this submission](day04/index#lars-erik-aabechs-solution) from [Lars-Erik Aabech](https://twitter.com/bleedo/status/1202751102107697153)
* Day 5 - no solution yet.
* [Day 6](day06/) - **solved** - both minimalist and idiomatic solutions to part 1. No part 2 yet. 
* Day 7 - not yet...
* [Day 8](day08/) – in progress!
