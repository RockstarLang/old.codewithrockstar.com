Adjacent takes a number
Let digits be a number with ""
Let index be 0
While index is less than 5
Cast digits at index into X
Cast digits at index plus 1 into Y
if X is Y
give back true

Build index up

Give back false


Increasing takes a number
Let digits be a number with ""
Let index be 0
While index is less than 5
Cast digits at index into X
Cast digits at index plus 1 into Y
if X is greater than Y
give back false

Build index up

Give back true



Listen to the inputs
Split the inputs into tokens using "-"
Cast tokens at 0 into lbound
Cast tokens at 1 into ubound

Let value be lbound
Let count be nothing
Until value is greater than ubound
If adjacent taking value is true and increasing taking value is true
Build count up

Build value up

Give back count
